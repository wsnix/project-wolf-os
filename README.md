wolf os, is a mini os writte on c++.
create for run on linux terminal.

in this firt version the system is a simple bin compiled with their archives that add more files/bin or archives with termination .txt etc.

the central idea is create a os exclusively for terminal with ascii interfaz, the funcionts i hope to add like.

2. easy interfaz with ascii.
3. mouse interactive with the interfaz
5. internet navigation real , but read only 
4. and possibly , the capacity to install other programs, but is dont secure this
